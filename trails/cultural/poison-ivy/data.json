  "text": "'Leaves of three, let it be.', 'Hairy vine? No friend of mine.', and other sayings help us remember this useful but dangerous plant. That's because Poison Ivy can be seen in many different shapes. Throughout the year this tree has several 'hairy' vines growing up it and during the Spring, Summer, and Fall you can see a three-leaved plant growing around the base of the tree and along the vines. These are all Poison Ivy and every part of the plant can cause a rash, blisters, and even more severe reactions in humans. \n While Poison Ivy is dangerous to people and a few other animals, like guinea pigs, many animals like turkey and deer rely on Poison Ivy for food. \n"
