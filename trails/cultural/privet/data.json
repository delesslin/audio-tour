  "text": "All nine species of privet currently in the southeast U.S. are invasive.[3] The first species of privet was introduced into the United States in the 1700s as an ornamental plant used as a hedge or foliage for gardens.[3] Glossy privet arrived in the U.S. in 1794, Chinese privet in 1825, Japanese privet in 1845, California privet in 1847, and Amur privet in 1860.[3] Privets escaped cultivation in the early 1900s, but became widely naturalized during the 1950s-1970s or later."
