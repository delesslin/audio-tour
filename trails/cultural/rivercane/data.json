  "text": "Canebrakes declined after European settlement of the American southeast. Factors involved in the decline include the introduction of livestock such as cattle, which eagerly graze on the leaves. The cane was considered a good forage for the animals until overgrazing began to eliminate canebrake habitat.[2] Other reasons for the decline include the conversion of the land for agriculture[7] and fire suppression.[8]"
