  "text": "Living along the River for thousands of years meant Catawbas had to develop many different ways of crossing and travelling the River. This is one example of a solution: a canoe. Traditionally these canoes would be crafted by cutting down a large, straight tulip poplar. After stripping the bark and letting the wood dry, a fire would be lit on top of the log. After the fire went out, the charcoal and ash would be scraped away. The process would be repeated until there was space to fit one or several people. This canoe's elegant shape comes from the use of carving tools."
