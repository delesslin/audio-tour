  "title": "Mulberry Tree",
  "narrator": "Roo George-Warren",
  "text": "Mulberry trees like this one love the edges of forests where they can be partially shaded. When they get enough sunlight then they will flower and produce fruits that look kind of like blackberries - both plants are part of the Rose family. These berries are known for their sweet flavor and dark purple color which will stain roads, sidewalks, clothes, and anything else they fall on. \n Mulberry trees were also traditionally used by Catawbas and other southeastern tribes as a fiber to turn into fabric as well as cordage, a type of rope."
